![](p8105_hw5_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png) There are more observations in the experimental arm than in the control arm over the weeks of the study.

Problem 2
=========

Importing the CSV

``` r
homicides = read_csv("./data-homicides-master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The data has 12 columns and 52179 rows. The columns/variables include: dates of homicide and information about the victim like their 's name, race, age. Additional variables include the city/state that the homicide occurred accompanied with latitude and longitude data. Finally, the dataset includes the disposition information, which describes if the case is closed with or without arrest. nn

``` r
homicides = homicides %>%
  unite(city, state, col = "city_state", sep = ", ")
```

summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

Number of homicides within cities:

``` r
city = homicides %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(total = n())
```

Number of unsolved homicides within cities:

``` r
unsolved = homicides %>% 
  filter(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest") %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(unsolved = n())
```

``` r
homicide_table = 
  merge(city, unsolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
```

Save prop.test as an object:

``` r
prop_test = 
  prop.test(homicide_table$unsolved, homicide_table$total)

  broom::tidy(prop_test) %>% 
  
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.646    0.628     0.663

All cities:

``` r
#all_city_homicides = 
#  merge(city, unsolved)

#all_cities = prop.test(all_city_homicides$unsolved, all_city_homicides$total)

#broom::tidy(all_cities) %>% 
```

``` r
#output = all_city_homicides %>% 
 # mutate(list = map2(.x = unsolved, .y = total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)))
```
