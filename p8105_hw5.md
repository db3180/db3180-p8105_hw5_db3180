Problem 2
=========

Importing the CSV

``` r
homicides = read_csv("./data-homicides-master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The data has 12 columns and 52179 rows. The columns/variables include: dates of homicide and information about the victim like their 's name, race, age. Additional variables include the city/state that the homicide occurred accompanied with latitude and longitude data. Finally, the dataset includes the disposition information, which describes if the case is closed with or without arrest. nn

``` r
homicides = homicides %>%
  unite(city, state, col = "city_state", sep = ", ")
```

Number of homicides within cities: 51
