Problem 2
=========

Importing the CSV

``` r
homicides = read_csv("./data-homicides-master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The data has 12 columns and 52179 rows. The columns/variables include: dates of homicide and information about the victim like their 's name, race, age. Additional variables include the city/state that the homicide occurred accompanied with latitude and longitude data. Finally, the dataset includes the disposition information, which describes if the case is closed with or without arrest. nn

``` r
homicides = homicides %>%
  unite(city, state, col = "city_state", sep = ", ")
```

summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

Number of homicides within cities:

``` r
city = homicides %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(total = n())
```

Number of unsolved homicides within cities:

``` r
unsolved = homicides %>% 
  filter(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest") %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(unsolved = n())
```

Creating a function:

``` r
homicide_function = function(df) {
  homicide_est = prop.test(df$unsolved, df$total)

  broom::tidy(homicide_est) %>% 
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
  }
```

``` r
all_city_homicides = 
merge(city, unsolved)
```

Baltimore:

``` r
all_city_homicides %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  homicide_function()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.646    0.628     0.663

All cities:

``` r
homicides_nested = nest(all_city_homicides, total, unsolved)

final_nested = 
  homicides_nested %>% 
  mutate(list = map(data, homicide_function)) %>% 
  unnest()
```

``` r
final_nested %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state , y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  coord_flip()
```
